gold jester
aleady have some of this designed: wall street shuffle, golden gun, snake oil

mana jester
it is what it sounds like. maybe, like, odd: inflict mana on enemy, even: inflict mana on self, and then glitterbomb and something like "heal 1 for each mana you have"

some bat that's like "do x+3 damage, disappears for this battle if you don't insert an [even/odd]" where even/odd changes based on turn parity.

the notion of cards that don't work unless you're also holding another specific card, ala MtG's "big furry monster" (i don't actually play mtg)

megamorpher: always shows up for scrap, gadget "upgrades" if spared this battle ala transformer

lock jester: some items make them roll locked dice for free, and then other items let them unlock those locked dice.
