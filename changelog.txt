Added a Jester episode: you start with a Delete skillcard, and have *1 of each equipment you can possibly attain in Episode 1*.
Added Vanish?. 50% chance that one of your dice vanishes whenever you use an equipment; decrements when triggered if not inflicted in its "ALL" form
Fixed missing self sfxdamage on Combat (that's not a typo, the card is literally named Combat)
Fixed missing self sfxdamage on Coldron and its swaps
Fixed Robobot? endlessly throwing errors to the console if you defeat an enemy while it's active.
Fixed Handcuffs- returning the dice.
Fixed Trick+ crash.
Fixed missing sfx on Necropost
Octobar+ is no longer redundant (went from must equal 10 to must equal 8... with a free 2)
Added more items
Really fixed Wisper inflicting the wrong statuses for real this time.
