Hand-drawn with side-by-side comparison: http://www.vintageguitar.com/wp-content/uploads/GIZMOTRON_02.jpg

Multiple layers for shading
"Gizmotron" bevel effect not done by hand
Slight pixel adjustments done tightly zoomed in

For a while I'd been thinking "hey wouldn't it be cool if ncrmod equipment could have graphical previews" which they can't obviously, but I got some cool ideas for what equipment would look like if I were to draw them anyway. I'm not a great artist though - especially so when I don't a reference - so I might stop at gizmotron

(This looks more like some cool gun than a guitar attachment but w/e)
