Jester,1,Hey there[;] friend!||Your enthusiasm is adorable[;] but I'll let|you in on a secret:||It's time for you to die!,I could have sworn it was time for you to die!||Is my watch wrong? What time do you make it?
Jester,2,Oh[;] you're back!||Wait[;] that was another giant dice.||Well[;] you're all equally doomed so there's no|point getting to know your names.,Are you sure you're not dead?||I mean[;] this show has a pretty rigid format and|survival isn't usually part of it...
Jester,3,Hey[;] it's a dice enemy!||How are you getting on with the dungeons?|Feeling at home yet?||After all[;] it's not like you're ever gonna leave!,...How are you doing this? It's like you believe|there's a way out or something!
Jester,4,Hey[;] it's a little dice buddy!||Sorry[;] friend[;] it's definitely for real time to die.,Y'know[;] you really remind me of me when I was a contestant.||But don't get your hopes up. It all seemed to be|going fine for me as well[;] at first.
Jester,5,What's going on with you dice[;] anyway?||Why are you still fighting?||Why haven't you been defeated yet?||This can't go on...,Wow. Wow! I never lost this often!||You know what? You're not going to win[;]|but I'm glad you're trying.||You just stick at it. Burn the dungeons|down. Why not?
Jester,6,Look[;] I wish I didn't have to stop you.||But I don't have a choice.,...huh. Huh!||I mean[;] you aren't going to win. You just aren't.||It's not possible.||But... maybe you could at least|get out of here?...||...|Yeah! You know what? You can!||Or at least[;] you can try! And I'm|coming with you!
Lady Luck Intro,1,...well. I thought I'd trapped you for eternity[;] but I see|you've been running around the Dungeons yet again.||I've come to get my friends.||And you've made some new ones?||Yeah[;] when I told them I was going to take you down|they were all really keen to join in.||You're not super popular around here[;] you know.||Oh[;] my dear.||I don't need popularity.||I have POWER.||As you're about to find out.,
Lady Luck,1,...well. I thought I'd trapped you for eternity[;] but I see|you've been running around the Dungeons yet again.,
Contestant,1,I've come to get my friends.,
Lady Luck,2,And you've made some new ones?,
Contestant,2,Yeah[;] when I told them I was going to take you down|they were all really keen to join in.||You're not super popular around here[;] you know.,

Lady Luck,4,You don't like my rules?||Well[;] BAD LUCK[;] because it's time for some more!||MORE RULES FOR EVERYONE!,
Lady Luck,5,Well[;] look at that[;] you're still just about alive.||And I know how hard you've worked to get this far -|it almost seems a shame to end it all.||Oh wait[;] no it doesn't.||In fact it seems LONG OVERDUE and VERY|SATISFYING TO ME PERSONALLY.,
Lady Luck,6,I warned you that you were doomed[;] and|you didn't believe me!||Let's see if it starts to sink in over the|next millennium or four.||BACK IN THE DUNGEONS. ALL OF|YOU. FOR ETERNITY.,
Lady Luck,7,Nooooooooo! IMPOSSIBLE!,
Lady Luck,8,...|...|...and AMAZING.,
Warrior_finale,1,I can do it! Just hold on!||We've come this far[;] I'm gonna get you|all[;] I promise!,
Thief_finale,1,I can make it!||But if you think I'm risking myself to come back and|get you lot[;] you're... you're...||...||UGH[;] I guess you're right. FINE.||Hold on[;] I'm gonna come and get you out!,
Robot_finale,1,Okay! Okay! I can do this!||You'll be okay[;] just wait for me!||Keep calm[;] remember those breathing|exercises I taught you.||AAAAA IT'S ALL DOWN TO ME WHAT DO I DO[;]|WHAT DO I DO?||BREATHE IN[;] 2[;] 3[;] 4! HOLD[;] 2[;] 3[;] 4!|OUT[;] 2[;] 3[;] 4!,

Beatrice,1,Well[;] if it isn't another dice!||Or wait[;] if it's only one of you[;]|is it 'douse'?|That sounds right. Anyway[;] welcome|to defeat[;] douse.,
Beatrice,2,Welcome to the end of your journey!|Prepare to douse!,
Beatrice,3,Hey[;] I looked it up and apparently 'douse' ISN'T the|singular of dice after all!||In modern usage 'dice' is both singular|and plural. Isn't that sweet!||Now: prepare to dice.,
Beatrice,4,Oh[;] sweetie[;] really? You're here to fight me again?|That is... so adorable.,
Beatrice,5,Oh[;] it's another dice!||Adorable! Which one are you?||No[;] don't tell me[;] I'm not going to remember[;]|honestly I was only asking to be polite.,
Beatrice,6,Oh hello there! I've been thinking about what to|say if you turned up again.||I was workshopping something around 'DICE-truction'[;]|but then I got bored of thinking about you.,
Beatrice,7,You again! You might trick me once[;] but I|won't let you trick me[;] dice.,
Beatrice,8,Welcome back[;] sweetie. Time to dice with death?|Hmm[;] no[;] just time to death some dice I think.,
Madison,1,Hi[;] I'm Madison! I'm 12 years old and I'm|here to make sure you lose!,
Madison,2,What[;] you're not even going to buy any cookies?||That's super rude!,
Madison,3,Hi! I'm Madison[;] and I only have one more fight to win|before I qualify for my 'Beating Dice Easily In|Boss Fights' badge!,
Madison,4,Hey! I'm Madison[;] and I'm going to grow up|to be like Lady Luck!||...and in the meantime[;] I'm going to make|your day REALLY MISERABLE!,
Madison,5,Oh HELLO! I was just writing in my diary and I|didn't have much to say about today...||But BEATING YOU TERRIBLY in a fight is|going to make a GREAT entry!,
Madison,6,Honestly it's SO rude of you to keep trying to beat us|all like this when it's CLEAR you're never going|to get your heart's desire.,
Madison,7,Hello! Would you like to buy some cookies?||Or would you rather I beat you in a big ol' fight?||Never mind[;] I know which one I'M in the mood for...,
Madison,8,Before I came down to the dungeons I used|to get told off for fighting.||Now I'm the boss of a whole episode! So LET'S FIGHT.,
Buster,1,Oh! Hello! Are you here to fight? Let's fight!||Who's a good fighter? I'm a good fighter!,
Buster,2,Oh! Is it time for more fighting? I love fighting! Let's go!,
Buster,3,Oh! I was asleep! But I can be awake!||Hello! Hello! I'm awake! Let's fight!,
Buster,4,Oh! I was sleeping again!||It's so weird that you always come when I'm asleep!||Oh or maybe it's because I'm ALWAYS asleep?|Anyway[;] let's fight!,
Buster,5,You're a dice! Hello! Hello! I love meeting dice!||DID YOU KNOW that DICE rhymes with NICE?||Maybe that's why you're a dice AND nice!|Let's fight!,
Buster,6,Oh! Hey! Do you like sleeping or fighting more?||MY favourite thing is to fight IN MY DREAMS[;]|so I can do both at once!,
Buster,7,Hey! Hey! It's me! I'm a good fighter!||Are you a good fighter? Let's find out!,
Buster,8,Oh! Is it time for a nap or a fight?||I know! Let's have a fight and THEN a nap!,
Buster,9,Oh! Oh! There's someone at the trapdoor! Quick!||Oh it's okay[;] it was you!||Are you here for a fight? I'm ready!,
Drake,1,Yeah okay then[;] let's fight. I told everyone to go easy on you[;]|you know[;] I wanted to take you out myself.,
Drake,2,I've got to fight a walking dice?||I'm FOUR HUNDRED and SEVENTY SIX years old.||This is entirely beneath my dignity. But|I guess let's get it over with.,
Drake,3,I can smell something. Have you been eating garlic?||It doesn't count if you win and|you've been eating garlic!,
Drake,4,Back when I first became a vampire[;] the people who tried|to fight me would wear top hats and huge petticoats|and they'd come in big horse-drawn carriages.||But now: another big old walking dice.,
Drake,5,Oh look[;] it's yet another dice come to fight me.||Well[;] good luck. I'm almost invulnerable and I'm five|centuries old[;] so fingers crossed for you I guess.,
Drake,6,Oh[;] it's time for another fight[;] is it?||Well[;] I'll have you know that I accidentally ate some garlic|naan earlier so I'm NOT feeling myself[;] but fine!||If it's a fight you want then it's a fight you'll get.,
Scathach,1,Ah[;] for the lost caress of the wind[;]|the call of the birds in the air.||Oh well. In the absence of any of that[;]|a fight'll do nicely.,
Scathach,2,The half-silent whisper of the underground night carried|news to me that you were nigh.||So I am entirely ready to beat you[;] just so you know.,
Scathach,3,The ethereal echoes of the cave speak to me of||your future[;] and they say:||You're about to die.,
Scathach,4,As fall the distant stars in the clear night sky[;]|so fall you in[;] you know...||...this fight that I'm about to beat you in.,
Scathach,5,When the dungeons deep beneath the earth|lie empty[;] and the moonlight shines into their|hollowed-out spaces...|...still will you be trapped here losing all|your fights like a loser.,
Scathach,6,Hey[;] I heard that eternity's blank eyes will see you|fall and falter and fall again. Starting now.,
Scathach,7,Deep below even these dungeons[;] the firey heart|of the earth awaits your inevitable failure.||So can we get started? Don't want to keep|the firey heart of the earth waiting.,
Scathach,8,Though the sweet river empties perpetually into the sea[;]|still is the sea itself filled with salt.||On a pretty similar note[;] it doesn't matter how|many times you come and fight me:||you're still going to lose.,
Aoife,1,Hey. It's over[;] dice kid.,
Aoife,2,Another fight? Yeah[;] go on then.,
Aoife,3,More fighting? I couldn't[;] I'm stuffed.||...|Ah okay[;] just one more.,
Aoife,4,Ooh[;] another fight? Don't mind if I do.,
Aoife,5,I swore I wasn't going to have a fight today[;] but|if you're going to leave it RIGHT THERE...,
Aoife,6,My dentist told me I shouldn't fight after|I've brushed my teeth.||So I fought her. I won[;] obviously.,
Aoife,7,I'm not really in the mood for fighting.||But if nobody else is going to take it...,
Aoife,8,Oh I've been in the mood for a big juicy fight all|day[;] and here you are. Perfect.,
Aoife,9,Oh[;] a fight? Honestly I couldn't[;] not an empty stomach.||Wait[;] no[;] I had some toast earlier so: YEAH|COME ON THEN LET'S GO.,
Aoife,10,Apparently I shouldn't be having more than|three or four fights a week.||So... you'd better make this one worth it.,
Audrey,1,Great to see you! Just a heads-up: I'm not gonna go|easy on you. I hope you've done your stretches!,
Audrey,2,One! Two! Three! Sword! And One! Two! Three! Shield!||Hope you've done all your drills!,
Audrey,3,Hey! You there! Believe in yourself!||You can do it! You can win!||Maybe not today[;] because I'm going to do my very|best to beat you[;] but... one day!,
Audrey,4,Ready for a fight? Yeah! Even if you don't|win it's good training!||Walk in strong[;] roll out stronger!,
Audrey,5,Yeah! It's fighting time! Remember: even if you lose[;] you're|still way ahead of the dice who aren't trying!,
Audrey,6,Yeah[;] it's you again! That's great! You're getting|better at this EVERY DAY.||And remember: you lose 100% of the fights you don't get into.,

Frog_finale,1,Wait[;] YOU'RE going up against Lady Luck?||YOU? You've barely been here five minutes!||What have YOU got to complain about?||I've been asking for better equipment for YEARS and nothing[;]|and now YOU think you're the one who's been wronged?||I'll show you!,
Frog_finale,2,WHAT. WHAT.||...|Hey um[;] if you DO manage to beat Lady Luck[;] could|you ask if I can get that sword upgrade I've been|asking for?||I could... I could come with you?|If that would help?,
Gardener_finale,1,You AGAIN? Trampling on my tomatoes?||Not that they get enough sunlight to ripen down|here[;] but that's NOT THE POINT.||Perish[;] enemy!,
Gardener_finale,2,...well. Well[;] I can't say I approve. But...||But if you're really going up against Lady Luck[;]|and you won't win but IF you do...||...could you get her to put a sunlight in?|I could... I could maybe help you?,
Hothead_finale,1,Ugh[;] you AGAIN. Why can't I ever get a cool|opponent to fight?||You know your friends are all doomed[;] right?,
Hothead_finale,2,...this is such a waste of time. You KEEP trying and|it's not going to get you ANYWHERE.||...|...|... Okay[;] look...||...I guess it's cool that you're going to try to take Lady Luck|down so I'm going to come with you.||But this DOESN'T mean you can tell|anyone we're hanging out.,
Magician_finale,1,Behold[;] nothing up my sleeves - except|your inevitable defeat!,
Magician_finale,2,Well. Very impressive.||Look[;] you don't... you don't need a magician|to help you out[;] do you?||I heard you're going up against Lady Luck[;] and there|are a few complaints from the rest of us that I|wouldn't mind raising with her...,

Robobot_finale,2,WOOOOO what a fight! Pew pew pew!||I'm SO fired up now[;] I wanna come with|you and fight some more!,
Rose_finale,1,You again! Outrageous! I deserve better than this.||It's ridiculous that I'm still lounging around on|level one fighting STILL MORE DICE when I'm|MORE than ready to be a boss.||This is the last straw!||As soon as I've beaten you I'm going STRAIGHT to Lady Luck|and putting in a formal complaint!,
Rose_finale,2,Look. I don't like you. I never will.||...but if you're really going to take on Lady Luck[;]|I'm going to come with you.,
Slime_finale,1,SLUUuuuurp! Slup!,
Slime_finale,2,...slurp? Slorp? ...slorple?,

Sneezy_finale,2,A... ... ...CHOO! Ugh[;] this SNEEZING.||...Look[;] is it okay if I come with you as well?|I'm SO sick of dungeons.||Literally: sick because of dungeons.||So if you're really trying to break everyone out|I wouldn't mind helping a little...,
Bully_finale,2,You think you're soooooo good just because|you're going to fight Lady Luck!||And you are. YOU ARE. I WOULD NEVER DARE.||LET ME FOLLOW YOU AND CARRY YOUR ROCKS.,

Yolanda_finale,1,What a fun group you are! Hiking around through|the Dungeons like this!,
Yolanda_finale,2,Here[;] I've got something for you. On the house.,
Yolanda_finale,3,You know what?,
Yolanda_finale,4,I love it here in the Dungeons[;] but|if you don't...,
