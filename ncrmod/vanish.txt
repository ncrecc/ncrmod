The theming for vanish is all over the place, and includes:
- Weird lighting
- Illusions and psychological manipulation
- The occult, e.g. ghosts (shocker)
- Weird inner energy psuedoscience
- Smoke. Smoke is scarey now. Also fog and mist.
- Non-sequitur OFF references
- Being scared
- And then Sceptre, which is just... there. I guess it sounds like something a necromancer would use or something. OH WAIT IT'S AN ANAGRAM OF "SPECT[RE/ER]" HAHAHAHAHAHAHA yeah still doesn't make sense.
