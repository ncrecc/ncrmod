- expand on floor (what the fuck is this supposed to mean?)

- do that thing where instead of using a fixed constant for helium speed increment you just do loadtext, e.g. mydice.y  += ~ + loadtext(~ncrmod/leadgravity~) + ~; and also do the same sort of thing for the robobot? card

- give platonic dice & make a wish some bug-testing. ALSO: confirm make a wish isnt just a crappy episode
