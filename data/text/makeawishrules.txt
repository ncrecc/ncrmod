h1|Make a Wish

All naturally spawned equipment are Blessed Wands of Wishing.
In this episode[;] and this episode only[;] you are not
allowed to wish for the same thing twice. This includes
alternate forms of an equipment - for example, if you wish
for Transformer at its tenth stage, you are not allowed to
then wish for Transformer at its ninth stage.

Make sure all wishes typed are in correct letter case!
