rat king: use old rat king design? four once per battle "1 dmg, 1 poison" cards and a card that gives more of those. or the breadcrumbs design i forget what it is.

haunted jar: chaotic leap guy? (5 dice, two size 1 unrestricted raw damage cards, dexterity charm)

cactus: that one cactus redesign jacke made. two min4 "get 1 thorns" items, one max5 raw damage item that's reuseable if you have thorns

super wisp: could do something really really hacky and stupid where it has a stripped down wand of wishing that actually guides it to type out a particular equipment. if that's too much effort just give it cfb wisp?... if ai is inclined to use powercards


super hj last words: "fucked up if true"

super wisp last words:
"if final dicey dungeons is just v0.7 dicey dungeons with more classes, guilds, equipment, and better art, i'd price it at about $5"
"but if entirely new features are thrown in like multiple branches, multiple bosses, extra team members, i'd say $10"

"freeze seems less interesting now that it's short-range curse imo"
"maybe if it worked like stunning a die and you had to insert another die"
"into the die... to use that die"

"what about a cauldron that "inverts" your die?"
"put in a 6, get a 1"
"put in a 4, get a 2"
"etc."
