- fix wildcard not showing slots. how it used to work is: the card is given slots, then the slots are drawn, then the slots are removed without telling the game to update the card's appearance (it almost never checks to update cards like this after they're created anyway -- not when card alpha is changed, for example). at some point i messed something up and now it updates after the slots were removed.
- fix fleeing crash in not just a robot, and occasisonally "(once)" gadgets not working
- buff revolver to cd6. at that point it's a solid sidegrade to two-handed sword
- make warrior's starting card closer to conventional sword? currently it's revolver, so in addition to your skillcard changing a bunch you also have to deal with your weapon now being drastically different.
- figure out enough about git to make ncrmod and ncrmod jr "synced" (new content added to ncrmod is instantly also added to jr, though maybe accounting for the generators being in a new spot, and any tweaks made to ncrmod are also attempted to be merged with jr)
- replace all the music with https://ncrecc.itch.io/ncrmusic or remove the music changes and link to ncrmusic
- finish witch. coming up with her starting spellbook is the difficult part. there's already some spells made with her in mind: lightreaver, flamebringer, bonecrusher, bookmark, rotary dial (boring/weird), magic axe, locket, shiny cauldron, cross check, gravity (gkind of bad), contact juggling, smoke signal, breaking point, boiling cauldron (could snap the game in half), magic cyanide, duplicauld (though i think i saw a megaquest item a lot like it). and then there's tons of items that aren't meant to be witch items but have a spell cost listed anyway, and some that are made to work with witch for the hell of it (e.g. panacea). should note i considered making bonecrusher a cost 2 magic axe (including once per battle) with a free1 and always curses.
- consider whether a witch episode where she gets jester decks as spells (maybe with spellcosts changed) could work. "not quite a jester"
- finish thief. his starter equipment is also tricky. lots of potential to show off the "every item works for everyone" shtick, e.g. wildcard, cfb inventor.
- get rid of the damn effort-reward imbalance by making the cool stuff i spent a lot of time on more prevalent. reverse emulation should be a level-up reward for someone. cybernetics could be buffed (no "one-use" gimmick and/or make your limit charge way faster somehow?) and given as a level-up reward to inventor. harvest scythe and lunasa being available for non-witch classes should be taken full advantage of, even if only as rare items - how it determines slot order is fairly unintuitive though (do a hack akin to wildcard & wand of wishing that makes numbers display on top of your cards?). same with all cfbs(?) but witch being compatible for everyone.
- add warrior (or thief!) episode based on never-finished keymaster character. see ncrecc/keymasterandfriends.
- add warrior episode where all items are "generic" and shift to other items of a certain type each battle
- add the grab bags (mentioned in equipment.csv). give trick bag to robot, offense bag to warrior, defense bag to inventor
- finish the other big swap rules (weaken <> reduce, curse <> lock) or throw them out entirely and somehow salvage the equipment made specifically for it.
- cross-pollinate item pools more?
- add the episode 6 arena which has been elaborated upon elsewhere (in #30 and todo.txt)
- add a more cars episode. more cars introduces "cars", a joke reskin of mana. all more cars items are already in ncrmod (cars count separately from mana now) and can show in bizarro world, now just make use of them. "car thief" episode?
- more vanish items all around
- promote the mod more (lol)
- this doesn't really have to do with ncrmod, but i considered making a "greatest hits" mod, where all items in starter layouts, level-up rewards, and item pools (and enemy equipment?) are replaced with various items from other mods, specifically curated to include the juciest stuff. maybe also curated custom episodes?

this was meant to be a megaquest-scale mod where every episode is custom. then i got bogged down in the details and failed to actually make progress.

this is just my list of intentions if anyone was curious, or wants to fork the mod and finish it. (which probably won't happen and doesn't need to happen - i've made my fair share of contributions to dicey already.)
