Sword in the Stone was a size 1 card whose gimmick was becoming even better when downgrading. It starts out as a MAX5 raw damage card, then the _downgraded version is unrestricted raw + 3, and the _weakened version is unrestricted double damage. It was deprecated by Broken Sword. (I actually posted Sword of the Stone in the beta mods channel once and terry said it was cool!)

Presto was formerly named Chef's Kiss (a meme within dicecord) then renamed once the actual Chef's Kiss showed up.

Confiscate was a gadget that locked one dice. It was deprecated by Bullseye. That was my most creative item ever.

Gavel was an even-only size 1 card that locked on 4. Upgrading it made it lock on 6. Eventually a "lock on x" card made it into the game as Fishing Net (this was a really early mod), and also Jackeea has a card named Gavel in his mod too and my Gavel was more boring so I removed it.

Facepalm was formerly named Very Bad Sword (as the inverse of Very Good Sword), then renamed once a card named Really Bad Sword showed up.
