creditz:

jackeea and themysticsword for more fluff and (private 1.0 version of) megaquest, i learned a lot from looking at the scripts in those
matz for inspiring me to actually work on this
cody for letting me bounce ideas off her, & coming up with lots of ways to do stuff
terry for putting up with my rubbish as always!
kirby_dungeons for suggesting the equipment "Roman Candle@ncrmod"
notan lemon for the icon for the "car" status

everything in this mod is by me except the music (but i did make the combat1 + halloweencombat1 remix, and looped stuff that needed to be looped) and most sfx (excluding vanish, which is a strangely edited robot jackpot noise)
